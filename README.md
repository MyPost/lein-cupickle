![A Pickle in a Cubicle](http://i.imgur.com/Ost19IX.png)

lein-cupickle is a Leiningen plugin that uses the [Cupickle](https://github.com/MyPost/cupickle)
library to run a set of cucumber features against a set of step definitions.

Stuck in your cubicle writing cucumber tests and clojure step-definitions?

Try lein-cupickle!


## Usage

Run `lein cupickle`.

Cupickle is configured in your project under the `:cupickle` key.

For information about the options available to lein-cupickle, refer
the the Cupickle library.

The two main config items you may be interested in are:

* :feature-path (defaults to "features")
* :step-path    (defaults to :feature-path)

These can be supplied as simple bare-word pairs on the shell:

> lein cupickle step-path special-features


### Project Setup

Use this for project-level plugins:

Put `[au.com.auspost/lein-cupickle "0.4.0"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your project.clj.

Put `[au.com.auspost/cupickle "0.2.0"]` into the `:dependencies`
vector of your project.clj if you are going to trigger cucumber test-runs from
within your code. This is not required if you only plan to trigger testing with
lein-cupickle.

Put `(:require [cupickle.steps :as cps])` into your namespace that is going to define steps.


### Example Feature

An example feature `unlock-grooved-cable.feature`:

		Feature: Unlock grooved cable
			@pre-unlock-cable
			Scenario: Unlocked grooved cable unlocked
				Given a grooved cable that is unlocked
				And the state of the cable is
				"""
				Dangerous
				"""
				When the pilot trys to unlock the grooved cable
				Then an error is raised
				"""
				Grooved cable already unlocked!
				"""
				And response :no-change is returned

			Scenario: Locked grooved cable unlocked
				Given a grooved cable that is locked
				When the pilot trys to unlock the grooved cable
				Then the state of the cable becomes
				"""
				Unlocked
				"""
				And a response :unlocked is returned

### Example step definition

An example step definition `grooved-cable-steps`:

		; The namespace should match the file-path with the step-path prefix removed
		(ns grooved-cable-steps
			(:require [cupickle.steps :refer :all]))

		; This is how you define a custom function without using the cupickle.steps macros
		(defn
			^{:cupickle-pattern #"Special case pattern .*"}
			foo-step [& x]
			(prn "Inside step-definition foo-step " x)
			(assert (re-matches #".*auth.*" (first x))))

		; Macros are available for the regular cucumber steps
		(Given #"a grooved cable that is (locked|unlocked)" [state]
					(assert (= state "Dangerous")))

		(Then #"the state.*" [& whatever]
					(prn "Inside Then step " whatever))

## Testing

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MyPost/lein-cupickle.svg)

There really isn't much to test for the lein plugin as it simply delegates everything to
the main Cupickle library...

However, dependency resolution is tested in [Travis-CI.](https://travis-ci.org/MyPost)

## TODO

* Table support
* Consider switching back from bultitude to tools.namespace
* Make sure that cupickle loads required dependencies
* Automatically translate "And", "But" steps to their previous step prefix
* Make statistics tally not interpret annotations as steps
* Test directly nested annotations
* Remove the dependency on cupickle from lein-cupickle as this dependency is injected into your project
* Trigger cupickle help from eval-in-project
* Allow cupickle profile to be specified in project
