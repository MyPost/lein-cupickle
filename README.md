# lein-cucumis

lein-cucumis is a Leiningen plugin that uses the [Cucumis](Link-Pending)
library to run a set of cucumber features against a set of step definitions.


## Usage

Run `lein cucumis`.

Cucumis is configured in your project under the `:cucumis` key.

For information about the options available to lein-cucumis, refer
the the Cucumis library.

The two main config items you may be interested in are:

* :feature-path (defaults to "features")
* :step-path    (defaults to :feature-path)

These can be supplied as simple bare-word pairs on the shell:

> lein cucumis step-path special-features

## TODO

Rename from Cucumis to something else. There seem to be enough projects called cucumis on github already...

Possibly digicumber? ogorek?
